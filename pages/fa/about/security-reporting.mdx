# Security Reporting

برای کسب جزئیات بیشتر در مورد خط مشی‌های امنیتی، به [این صفحه](https://github.com/nodejs/node/security/policy) سر بزنید.

## Reporting a bug in Node.js

برای گزارش باگ‌های امنیتی در Node.js از [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/nodejs) استفاده کنید.

گزارش شما طی ۵ روز تصدیق خواهد شد و شما یک پاسخ با جزئیات بیشتر حاوی مراحل بعدی در بررسی گزارش‌تان را در ۱۰ روز دریافت خواهید کرد.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported
issue.

### Node.js bug bounty program

The Node.js project engages in an official bug bounty program for security
researchers and responsible public disclosures. The program is managed through
the HackerOne platform. See [https://hackerone.com/nodejs](https://hackerone.com/nodejs) for further details.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective
maintainers.

## Disclosure policy

Here is the security disclosure policy for Node.js

* The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This
  person will coordinate the fix and release process. The problem is confirmed
  and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find
  any potential similar problems. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are
  still under maintenance. These fixes are not committed to the public
  repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.

* A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and a CVE (Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®)) is requested for the vulnerability.

* On the embargo date, the Node.js security mailing list is sent a copy of the
  announcement. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new builds
  are deployed to nodejs.org. Within 6 hours of the mailing list being
  notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the Node.js blog.

* Typically the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time the CVE is
  issued. However, this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
  difficulty in applying a fix.

* This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required
  with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the
  bug in as timely a manner as possible; however, it's important that we follow
  the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a
  consistent manner.

## Receiving security updates

Security notifications will be distributed via the following methods.

* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-sec)
* [Node.js Blog](/blog)

## Comments on this policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org) or
[file an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/new) to discuss.

## OpenSSF Best Practices

</a>

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Best Practices badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge) is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify how they follow each best practice. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
